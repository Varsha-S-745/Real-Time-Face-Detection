# Real-Time-Face-Detection

Project Description:
         The project is a real-time face detection system that detects human faces from a live webcam feed. It employs Python and OpenCV, which is one of the strongest libraries for image and video processing. The system utilizes a Haar Cascade Classifier, a pre-trained machine learning model to detect faces. Since the webcam records video, every frame is processed to locate and highlight faces using green rectangles, so it's an interactive and useful demonstration of real-world computer vision abilities. The system can be used as a building project for more sophisticated applications such as facial recognition, emotion analysis, and smart surveillance systems.


Goal:
1) To create a system capable of detecting faces of human beings in real-time from a webcam.
2) To apply Haar Cascade Classifier to facial pattern detection.
3) To get hands-on experience with computer vision methods via OpenCV.
4) To create a starting point for future enhancements like:
       a) Facial recognition
       b) Emotion detection
5) Automated attendance or surveillance


Tools and Technologies Employed:
1) Python 3.x
2) OpenCV Library
3) Haar Cascade Classifier (Pre-trained model for face detection)
4) Webcam for live video stream
